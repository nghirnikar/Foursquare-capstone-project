    "Toronto  the famous places in the world. They are diverse in many ways. Both are multicultural as well as the financial hubs of their respective countries. We want to explore how much they are similar or dissimilar in aspects from a tourist point of view regarding food, accommodation, beautiful places, and many more.\n",
    "Today Tourism is one of the pillars of the economy and the people most often visits those countries who are rich in heritage and developed enough from a foreign prospective, like friendly environment. Every city is unique in their own way and give something new. And now the information is so common regarding location of every place around the world on your fingertips which make it easier to explore. Therefore, tourists always eager to travel to different places on the basis of available information, and the comparison (the part of the information) between the two cities always assist to choose the specific places or according to their choice.\n"

    "For this problem, we will get the services of Foursquare API to explore the data of two cities, in terms of their neighborhoods. The data also include the information about the places around each neighborhood like restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, parks, theaters, art galleries, museums and many more. We selected one Borough from each city to analyze their neighborhoods. Manhattan from New York and Downtown Toronto from Toronto. We will use machine learning technique, “Clustering” to segment the neighborhoods with similar objects on the basis of each neighborhood data. These objects will be given priority on the basis of foot traffic (activity) in their respective neighborhoods. This will help to locate the tourist’s areas and hubs, and then we can judge the similarity or dissimilarity between two cities on that basis"

For data verification and further exploration, we use Foursquare API to get the coordinates of Downtown Toronto and explore its neighborhoods. The neighborhoods are further characterized as venues and venue categories.\n",
